# Pokémon Crystal NoRTC

This is a fork of the Pokémon Crystal disassembly by the /pret team. 
It serves as an experiment for detecting missing RTC hardware and implementing a bypass using the game timer.
Will also apply common bugfixes to this repository to act as a jumping-off point for other projects.
